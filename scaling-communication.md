# Scaling Communication

Bringing efficiency into our communication tools and patterns.

## Why

* We failed
* Surfaces everywhere
  - Sales
  - CSS
  - Code

## DigitalOcean Values

* Strive for _simple_ and _elegant_ solutions.
* _Respect_ your peers.
* _Speak up_ and _listen_ when others do.
* _Trust_ and be _trustworthy_.
* Our community is bigger than just us.
* **Love** is what makes us great.

--

## Empathy

* Starts with others
* Not linear
* Before delegating, prune details as much as possible
* But add necessary context
* Be direct
